      Select the model for speech recognition. Models differ in size, speed,
      and accuracy.

      Enables a lightweight version of the model. It runs faster but may have 
      slightly lower accuracy.

      The processing device for inference. 'cpu' is the standard option. 'cuda'
      uses onnxruntime-gpu for acceleration, which requires a compatible NVIDIA GPU
      and drivers on the host system. The add-on will fall back to 'cpu' if CUDA
      is unavailable.
  debug:
    name: Debug Logging
    description: >-
      Enables verbose logging in the add-on's log. This is useful for
      diagnosing problems.
